# # The Publish.jl Literate Source Code
#
# !!! info "A quick note..."
#
#     It's worth pointing out here that your own package doesn't need to follow
#     this style of writing it in a literate way and probably shouldn't. This
#     has been done for [`Publish`](#) so as to test out all of it's available
#     functionality.
#
# Welcome to the [`Publish`](#) package source code. Since [`Publish`](#)
# supports a subset of [Literate.jl][] syntax the source for this package
# itself makes a good test case for it.
#
# [Literate.jl]: https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl
#
# The content below and on the subsequent pages is all drawn from the source
# code of this package found under the `src/` directory.
#
# Displayed code blocks are the source code of this package and any markdown
# content is a comment line starting with `#`.
#
# Let's start off our exploration of the package with the `Publish` module
# definition as well as a docstring that appears prior to it.
"""
The `Publish` package provides tools for composing [markdown files](#
"Source Types"), [Jupyter Notebooks](#), and [Literate Julia](#) files into
[HTML](# "`html`") and [PDF](# "`pdf`") documents in a declarative and
reproducable way.

`Publish` documents are represented by [`Project`](#) objects that store the
information presented in a `Publish` [configuration](#) file, which also
happens to be the same `Project.toml` file used by Julia's `Pkg` package
manager.

To get started using `Publish` by spinning up a web-server for a package
of your choosing run the following:

```julia-repl
julia> serve(MyPackage)
âœ“ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8000/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

See the [getting started](#) section of the manual for more details.
