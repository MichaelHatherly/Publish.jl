This is a package for [Julia][] that provides a general framework for writing
prose --- technical documentation is it's focus, though it is general enough to
be applied to any kind of written document.

Some standout features:

  - built-in live server to view your changes in real-time,
  - uses a fully-compliant [commonmark][] parser, [CommonMark.jl][],
  - produces HTML and PDF files natively, no LaTeX dependencies to manage yourself,
  - publication-quality PDF generation uses [tectonic][] for self-contained, reproducible builds,
  - combine markdown files, [Jupyter][] notebooks, and Julia files for your content,
  - and declarative configuration built on top of Julia's [Pkg.jl][] package manager.

`Publish` can scale from single pages all the way to large cross-referenced
multi-project documents.

To jump straight in and begin using `Publish` run the following in your Julia REPL:

```julia-repl
pkg> add Publish

julia> using Publish

julia> serve(Publish)
âœ“ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8000/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

The above will install `Publish`, import it, and then start up a local
web-server for `Publish`'s own documentation --- the content you're reading
right now. Open the link in your web browser and then continue on to the next
section, [Getting Started](docs/getting_started.md).
